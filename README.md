# Flutter Solid Notifications

A Flutter application implementing SOLID principles for a clean and scalable architecture in local notification management.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates how to apply SOLID principles to a real Flutter application. Each principle is implemented practically to improve the maintainability, scalability, and testability of the code:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle
